Packages are a way of structuring many packages and modules which helps in a well-organized hierarchy of data set, making the directories and modules easy to access. Just like there are different drives and folders in an OS to help us store files, similarly packages help us in storing other sub-packages and modules, so that it can be used by the user when necessary.
